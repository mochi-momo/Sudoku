Hi! I made this game for a Python project in school.
In this repository the sudoku_board_solver.py file takes a preformatted file for a sudoku puzzle and outputs a solution.
The sudoku_game.py file uses pygame to make a gui for the game where you can play the game for yourself and then check and see if you had the correct solution.

There are still a few issues with the code that I am still working on so the project is unfinished.
